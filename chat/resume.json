  "headline": "Full stack marketer and engineer who builds AI powered systems that drive growth and reduce manual work.",
  "professional_summary": "I have delivered more than 100 marketing and technical projects across multiple industries. Eight years at Highland taught me what drives real commercial results, not vanity metrics. The last several years in tech roles at Phonelo AI and Ashton Gray gave me the engineering experience to build systems that support those outcomes. This mix lets me do something most cannot. I can identify what the business needs, design the customer facing experience, and then build the automation, data flows, and AI tooling that make the process scalable. I enjoy solving problems at the point where business goals, modern technology, and real user behavior meet.",

  "marketing_summary": {
    "overview": "10 years of marketing experience, including eight years at Highland International where I moved from specialist to manager to head of marketing. That time gave me a ground up understanding of how customers behave, how markets shift, and what actually drives growth. I did not inherit marketing systems. I built them, tested them, and refined them with real revenue outcomes. That experience now informs how I design and connect technology, automation, and AI tools to business goals.",
    "experience_depth": {
      "full_funnel": "I learned how to run the entire lifecycle of demand generation. I conducted customer research, developed messaging based on real objections, built campaigns that targeted each awareness stage, and connected everything to sales outcomes. I have created SEO strategies, paid search structures, landing pages, email nurture paths, and analytics dashboards that tracked progress from interest to revenue.",
      "seo_and_content": "I rebuilt site structure around intent clusters, cleaned up index bloat, and aligned metadata with how people searched rather than how the business described itself. I created anchor content that drew traffic from national competitors and used internal linking and page authority to lift entire product lines in search. That work tripled organic traffic and created steady compounding gains.",
      "paid_search": "I ran paid campaigns that produced measurable results instead of vanity traffic. I refined keyword strategy, developed landing page alignment, reduced wasted spend through negative keyword filters, and used call tracking to confirm attribution. I paused campaigns that brought leads but not pipeline and focused budget where outcomes proved themselves. This doubled qualified leads while reducing cost per conversion.",
      "product_launches": "I launched multiple products from concept to revenue. I did the market research, messaging strategy, label design, sales collateral, online positioning, and distributor enablement. That experience taught me how to align marketing, product, and sales so that the story, offer, and delivery were unified.",
      "content_strategy": "I wrote copy, guides, articles, landing pages, email sequences, and collateral that supported real sales conversations. I tested headlines, structure, and tone until the market confirmed what worked. I learned what makes someone click and what makes them buy.",
      "cross_functional_alignment": "I worked directly with leadership to tie campaigns to revenue goals. I partnered with sales teams to understand objections and built materials that supported those conversations. I created reporting that gave leaders clarity instead of noise. This taught me how to move teams from ideas to execution."
    },
    "how_it_connects_to_my_tech_work": "My marketing foundation lets me build technology, automation, and AI systems that do not sit in isolation. I understand what needs to happen between a campaign and a closed deal, so when I build tools, they serve a real business purpose. This combination of marketing experience and engineering skill lets me solve problems end to end instead of handing off incomplete work.",

  "experience_summary": "Over 100 projects delivered across marketing and engineering. I combine customer insight with hands on technical execution to create workflows that cut waste, increase clarity, and support measurable growth.",
  "unique_value": "Lots of people can run campaigns and lots of people can write code. Very few can do both well enough to connect strategy, brand, data, and automation into a system that produces repeatable outcomes. That is where I am strongest.",
