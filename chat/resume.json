  "headline": "Marketing Technology & Revenue Systems Leader who builds workflows, platforms, and data governance that drive growth.",
  "professional_summary": "I use my background in marketing and engineering to build and own revenue systems. I focus on the core parts of the GTM stack that must work together reliably: web platforms, CRM architecture, analytics, and automation. My approach emphasizes embedded data governance to ensure teams can trust their data. I turn revenue goals into clear technical plans, reduce manual work through automation, and build reporting foundations that improve attribution and decision making.",

  "marketing_summary": {
    "overview": "10 years of marketing experience, including eight years at Highland International where I moved from specialist to manager to head of marketing. That time gave me a ground up understanding of how customers behave, how markets shift, and what actually drives growth. I did not inherit marketing systems. I built them, tested them, and refined them with real revenue outcomes. That experience now informs how I design and connect technology, automation, and AI tools to business goals.",
    "experience_depth": {
      "full_funnel": "I learned how to run the entire lifecycle of demand generation. I conducted customer research, developed messaging based on real objections, built campaigns that targeted each awareness stage, and connected everything to sales outcomes. I have created SEO strategies, paid search structures, landing pages, email nurture paths, and analytics dashboards that tracked progress from interest to revenue.",
      "seo_and_content": "I rebuilt site structure around intent clusters, cleaned up index bloat, and aligned metadata with how people searched rather than how the business described itself. I created anchor content that drew traffic from national competitors and used internal linking and page authority to lift entire product lines in search. That work tripled organic traffic and created steady compounding gains.",
      "paid_search": "I ran paid campaigns that produced measurable results instead of vanity traffic. I refined keyword strategy, developed landing page alignment, reduced wasted spend through negative keyword filters, and used call tracking to confirm attribution. I paused campaigns that brought leads but not pipeline and focused budget where outcomes proved themselves. This doubled qualified leads while reducing cost per conversion.",
      "product_launches": "I launched multiple products from concept to revenue. I did the market research, messaging strategy, label design, sales collateral, online positioning, and distributor enablement. That experience taught me how to align marketing, product, and sales so that the story, offer, and delivery were unified.",
      "content_strategy": "I wrote copy, guides, articles, landing pages, email sequences, and collateral that supported real sales conversations. I tested headlines, structure, and tone until the market confirmed what worked. I learned what makes someone click and what makes them buy.",
      "cross_functional_alignment": "I worked directly with leadership to tie campaigns to revenue goals. I partnered with sales teams to understand objections and built materials that supported those conversations. I created reporting that gave leaders clarity instead of noise. This taught me how to move teams from ideas to execution."
    },
    "how_it_connects_to_my_tech_work": "My marketing foundation lets me build technology, automation, and AI systems that do not sit in isolation. I understand what needs to happen between a campaign and a closed deal, so when I build tools, they serve a real business purpose. This combination of marketing experience and engineering skill lets me solve problems end to end instead of handing off incomplete work.",

  "rev_ops_fit": {
    "summary": "I'm a good fit for RevOps because my background covers the four main areas the role requires: marketing, sales, systems, and enablement.

    "breakdown": {
      "revenue_engine_context": "I understand how revenue teams work because I've been part of them. With ten years in marketing, I know how campaigns, attribution, and funnels operate. I also have experience with cold calling, so I know what sales reps actually need to close deals. This helps me build systems that make their jobs easier rather than adding unnecessary steps.",
      "systems_thinking": "My computer science background helps me approach RevOps with an engineering mindset. I focus on breaking problems down to their root causes and understanding how different systems connect. Instead of just fixing individual tickets, I try to build scalable processes that prevent issues from happening in the first place.",
      "technical_execution": "I can handle the technical side of things myself. I write Node.js, which is useful for HubSpot APIs and custom automations. This means I can connect systems, clean up data, and fix bottlenecks directly without always needing to wait for a developer to step in.",
      "enablement_and_adoption": "I focus on making sure people actually use the systems I build. I enjoy teaching and can explain technical concepts in a way that makes sense to non-technical teams. I also use AI tools to create quick training materials, ensuring that new processes are adopted rather than ignored."
    },
    "value_statement": "I understand the goals of revenue teams, build the systems to support them, and help the organization adopt those systems effectively.",
    "strategic_impact": "For growing companies, I can help establish clean CRM architecture, clear lifecycle stages, and reliable data for ABM. I focus on automation that saves time and reduces manual work. My background has prepared me to step into a RevOps role and start contributing immediately."
