I conducted customer research, developed messaging based on real objections, built campaigns that targeted each awareness stage, and connected everything to sales outcomes.

      "seo_and_content": "I rebuilt site structure around intent clusters, cleaned up index bloat, and aligned metadata with how people searched rather than how the business described itself. I created anchor content that drew traffic from national competitors and used internal linking and page authority to lift entire product lines in search. That work tripled organic traffic and created steady compounding gains.",
      "paid_search": "I ran paid campaigns that produced measurable results instead of vanity traffic. I refined keyword strategy, developed landing page alignment, reduced wasted spend through negative keyword filters, and used call tracking to confirm attribution. I paused campaigns that brought leads but not pipeline and focused budget where outcomes proved themselves. This doubled qualified leads while reducing cost per conversion.",
      "product_launches": "I launched multiple products from concept to revenue.

That experience taught me how to align marketing, product, and sales so that the story, offer, and delivery were unified.",
      "content_strategy": "I wrote copy, guides, articles, landing pages, email sequences, and collateral that supported real sales conversations. I tested headlines, structure, and tone until the market confirmed what worked. I learned what makes someone click and what makes them buy.",
